// Process hardening applied before any key material exists.
//
// Two distinct exposures, with very different severity:
//
// Core dumps are the urgent one. A crash writes the entire process image,
// including every decrypted private key in the vault, to wherever the kernel's
// core_pattern sends it. On a systemd machine that is systemd-coredump, which
// keeps dumps on disk under /var/lib/systemd/coredump. Nothing about full-disk
// encryption helps while the system is running.
//
// Swap is the lesser one. Pages holding keys can be written to a swap device
// and recovered from it after power-off. If swap sits on an encrypted volume
// that risk is already covered, which is the common case on a modern install,
// so locking memory is defence in depth rather than the main event.
